# ADR 1: Technical Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a responsive single-page application that displays and manages task items. The solution needs to be maintainable, performant, and provide excellent developer experience.

## Decision

### Core Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: Chosen for robust type safety and extensive ecosystem
- **TanStack Router**: Selected over React Router for superior type safety and modern DX
- **Material UI**: Chosen for production-ready components and consistent design
- **Vite**: Selected for superior build performance and modern dev experience

### Key Considerations
1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript and TanStack Router provide end-to-end type safety
2. **Performance**: Vite offers excellent build and dev performance
3. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and excellent debugging capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- End-to-end type safety
- Excellent developer experience
- Modern, maintainable codebase
- Production-ready UI components

### Challenges
- Learning curve for TanStack Router (mitigated by good documentation)
- Bundle size considerations with MUI (will implement code splitting if needed)

## Alternatives Considered
- React Router: More common but less type-safe
- Create React App: More traditional but slower development experience
